Precision Irrigation Using AI
📌 Project Overview

Precision Irrigation Using AI is a smart agriculture project that leverages artificial intelligence to optimize water usage in farming. By analyzing soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop type, the system recommends the exact amount of water required, reducing waste and improving crop yield.

🎯 Objectives

Optimize irrigation schedules using data-driven insights

Reduce water consumption and irrigation costs

Improve crop health and yield through precision farming

Support sustainable and climate-smart agriculture

🧠 How It Works

The system uses synthetic sensor and weather data such as:

Soil moisture level

Temperature

Humidity

Rainfall

Crop type

An AI-based logic/model processes these inputs to recommend the ideal irrigation volume for each day.

📂 Dataset

The dataset (exported to Excel) includes:

Date

Soil Moisture (%)

Temperature (°C)

Humidity (%)

Rainfall (mm)

Crop Type

Recommended Irrigation (Liters)

All data used in this project is synthetically generated for simulation and learning purposes.
